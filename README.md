# flask-poc

A simple project to demonstrate HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE), already documented with Swagger and working with a database.
Simple, yet very functional, creating a virtual environment to install only what's necessary (venv) and installing within this environment whatever is needed, while also ensuring that the correct dependencies will always be reinstalled (requirements.txt).
